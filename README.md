# Git Github 101
## Task 1
Create a good GitHub profile by naming your repository similar to your account name.
You may search for cool elements to add to your profile from Google.

## Task 2
Contribute to this repository by following these steps:
* Fork this repository to make a copy of this in your own account.
* Use the command ``git clone URL`` to clone the repo to your personal computer. The URL should be of the forked repository.
* Now add the upstream URL using ``git remote add upstream URL``. This URL is of the main repository, i.e, this repository.
* Edit README.md to add your name along with your GitHub profile link.
* Make a branch using the command ``git branch branchName``.
* Checkout to that branch using ``git checkout branchName``.
* Now stage and commit the files using ``git add .``; ``git commit -m "message"``.
* Push these changes to your forked repo using ``git push origin branchName``.
* In your forked repo, click on a green button called "Compare & pull request".
* Now sit back and wait patiently for me to merge your pull request!

Please ask your doubts to Google and on the WhatsApp group ;)
